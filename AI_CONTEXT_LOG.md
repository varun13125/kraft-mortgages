**Summary of Changes:**
- Fixed critical blog content rendering issues across the site
- Replaced ReactMarkdown with dangerouslySetInnerHTML for proper HTML rendering on single post pages
- Created comprehensive content processing utilities in `apps/web/lib/utils/blog-content.ts`
- Implemented image placeholder processing to convert `[IMAGE: Description]` to styled `<img>` tags with placeholder images
- Enhanced blog index page to generate dynamic excerpts from actual post content instead of generic summaries
- Added HTML tag stripping and word count truncation for better excerpt generation (25-30 words)
- Updated prose styling to handle images properly with dark theme integration
- Improved typography and content display across blog section

**Technical Implementation:**
- Created `processImagePlaceholders()` function using regex to replace image placeholders with styled img tags
- Added `processExcerptContent()` to generate meaningful excerpts by stripping HTML and truncating to 150 characters
- Updated `apps/web/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` to use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with processed content
- Modified `apps/web/app/blog/page.tsx` transformPost function to use dynamic excerpt generation
- Applied proper Tailwind prose classes for dark theme compatibility

**Verification:**
- Tested locally - HTML content now renders properly instead of showing raw tags
- Blog index page displays meaningful excerpts generated from actual post content
- Image placeholders are converted to styled images with proper dimensions
- All styling maintains consistency with Kraft Mortgages dark theme and gold accents

**Next Steps:**
- Test with actual blog posts containing image placeholders
- Consider adding image optimization and lazy loading for production
- Monitor content rendering performance with larger blog collections
- Add error handling for malformed HTML content in future blog posts
