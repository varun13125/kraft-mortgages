**Summary of Changes:**
- Added functional appointment booking link to blog post content
- Replaced static consultation button with clickable Google Calendar link
- Updated both `getPost()` and `getRecentPosts()` functions in firestore.ts
- Ensured appointment link opens in new tab with proper rel attributes
- Maintained button styling while adding hyperlink functionality

**Problem Identified:**
User reported "for now it has button but no link" - the consultation booking button existed in the blog content but was not a functional hyperlink. The button styling was present but lacked the actual href attribute to connect to the Google Calendar appointment system.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Modified `apps/web/lib/db/firestore.ts` mock blog content
- Replaced static button element with proper anchor tag:
  ```html
  <a href="https://calendar.app.google/HcbcfrKKtBvcPQqd8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="display: inline-block; background-color: #1e3a8a; color: white; padding: 12px 24px; border: none; border-radius: 6px; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; transition: background-color 0.3s ease; text-decoration: none;">Book a 15 min Free Consultation Now</a>
  ```
- Applied to both single post content and recent posts content
- Preserved existing button styling through inline CSS
- Added proper accessibility attributes (target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer")

**Status:**
Appointment booking functionality is now fully integrated into blog content. Users can click the consultation button to book appointments through Google Calendar.

**Next Steps:**
- Commit changes to Git repository
- Deploy to production via Vercel
- Test appointment link functionality on live site

**Summary of Changes:**
- Fixed author data structure inconsistency causing JavaScript errors in blog pages
- Updated blog index `transformPost` function to properly handle author object structure
- Used `post.author?.name` fallback to prevent `split is not a function` errors
- Resolved cached compilation errors preventing blog page rendering
- Ensured consistency between mock data structure and component expectations

**Problem Identified:**
The blog post page was throwing `TypeError: post.author.split is not a function` errors because the author field was being handled inconsistently. Mock data provides author as an object `{name: 'Varun Chaudhry', ...}`, but the transform function was overriding it with string fallbacks.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Modified `apps/web/app/blog/page.tsx` transformPost function
- Changed `author: post.author || 'Varun Chaudhry'` to `author: post.author?.name || post.author || 'Varun Chaudhry'`
- Maintains backward compatibility with both string and object author formats
- Prevents split function errors when author is an object

**Status:**
Blog content rendering should now work properly with both:
1. Full content excerpts (30-word generation from actual content)
2. Proper author field handling (no more split errors)
3. Consistent data structure between mock posts and components

**Next Steps:**
- Test blog page functionality after cache clears
- Verify excerpt generation displays properly on production deployment
- Monitor for any remaining data structure inconsistencies

**Summary of Changes:**
- Fixed actual blog post content issue preventing proper excerpt generation
- Updated mock post data in `getRecentPosts()` to include full blog content instead of single sentence
- Resolved root cause of generic "Stay tuned for expert insights" message in blog previews
- Mock post now contains complete blog content for meaningful excerpt generation
- Verified excerpt generation works properly with full content (30-word excerpts)

**Problem Identified:**
While the previous fix correctly implemented word-based excerpt generation, the mock post data in `getRecentPosts()` only contained a single sentence instead of the full blog content. This meant the excerpt generation had insufficient content to work with, resulting in generic fallback messages.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Updated `apps/web/lib/db/firestore.ts` `getRecentPosts()` function
- Replaced minimal mock content with complete blog article content
- Added full HTML blog post content including headers, paragraphs, and structured sections
- Maintained consistency with `getPost()` function content structure

**Verification:**
- Tested excerpt generation with full content - produces meaningful 30-word summaries
- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- Blog preview cards will now display actual content excerpts instead of generic text

**Next Steps:**
- Deploy fix to resolve blog excerpt display issue
- Monitor blog page to verify proper content rendering
- Test with additional blog posts when available

**Summary of Changes:**
- Fixed incomplete blog post excerpt generation on main `/blog` page
- Updated `apps/web/app/blog/page.tsx` to use proper word-based excerpt generation (25-30 words)
- Replaced character-based truncation with word-based truncation as originally requested
- Modified `transformPost` function to use `generateExcerpt` instead of `processExcerptContent`
- Updated both main excerpt and SEO description to use consistent word-based generation
- Verified TypeScript compilation and functionality

**Technical Implementation:**
- Changed import from `processExcerptContent` to `generateExcerpt`
- Updated excerpt generation from 150 characters to 30 words with "..." suffix
- Applied word-based truncation to both article preview cards and SEO meta descriptions
- Maintained fallback order: metaDescription → excerpt → dynamically generated excerpt

**Problem Solved:**
The previous fix was incomplete - while HTML rendering and image processing were fixed, the blog post preview cards were still using character-based truncation (150 characters) instead of the requested word-based truncation (25-30 words). Now excerpts are properly generated by stripping HTML tags and truncating to 30 words.

**Next Steps:**
- Deploy updated excerpt generation to production
- Test with additional blog posts to verify consistent excerpt quality
- Consider adding customizable word count per post type or category
