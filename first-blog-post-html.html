    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div class="prose prose-lg prose-invert max-w-none text-gray-300">
      <p>We've seen it countless times: a savvy, self-employed business owner or a new Canadian with a solid financial footing gets a hard "no" from their bank. Why? Because their file doesn't fit neatly into the standard boxes required to pass the mortgage stress test. We know the pain and frustration of feeling like the system isn't designed for you. That's where <strong class="text-gold-400">Kraft Mortgages</strong> steps in.</p>

      <p>Passing the mortgage stress test isn't just about the rate you're offered; it's about proving your ability to handle payments at a significantly higher qualifying rate. For those with non-traditional income, this can feel like an insurmountable hurdle. But it's not. It's a matter of strategy, documentation, and expert navigation.</p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-100 mt-12 mb-6 text-gold-400">Everyday Expert Translation: What the Stress Test Really Means</h2>
    <div class="prose prose-lg prose-invert max-w-none text-gray-300 mb-8">
      <p>In simple terms, the stress test is a financial simulation. Lenders must check if you could still afford your mortgage payments if interest rates were to rise significantly. This is designed to protect both you and the lender. However, the rigid income calculations used by major banks often fail to capture the full financial picture of self-employed individuals, investors, or those new to the Canadian financial system.</p>

    <!-- Section: Case Study -->
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-100 mt-12 mb-6 text-gold-400">Case Study: The Self-Employed Professional</h2>
    <div class="prose prose-lg prose-invert max-w-none text-gray-300 mb-8">
      <p>We recently worked with a successful consultant in Surrey. Her business was thriving, but because she maximized her business write-offs (a smart tax strategy), her declared income on paper looked modest. Her bank saw only the bottom line and declined her mortgage application.</p>

      <p>Our approach was different. By leveraging alternative income validation strategies and working with a lender specializing in business-for-self files, we were able to present a comprehensive financial picture that showcased her true earning power and cash flow. The result? She was approved for the home she wanted, with a competitive rate and terms. This is a common success story for our clients.</p>

    <!-- Section: Three Actionable Strategies -->
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-100 mt-12 mb-6 text-gold-400">Three Actionable Strategies for Complex Borrowers:</h2>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-200 mt-8 mb-4">1. Optimize Your Down Payment</h3>
    <div class="prose prose-lg prose-invert max-w-none text-gray-300 mb-6">
      <p>A larger down payment reduces the loan-to-value ratio, making you a less risky borrower. We can help you strategize the optimal amount to put down without depleting your necessary liquidity.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-200 mt-8 mb-4">2. Leverage Alternative Lenders</h3>
    <div class="prose prose-lg prose-invert max-w-none text-gray-300 mb-6">
      <p>The big banks aren't your only option. We have deep relationships with lenders who specialize in assessing complex income structures, from dividends and capital gains to business bank statements.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-200 mt-8 mb-4">3. Structure Your File for Success</h3>
    <div class="prose prose-lg prose-invert max-w-none text-gray-300 mb-6">
      <p>Before you even apply, we work with you to organize your financial documentation. This isn't just about gathering papers; it's about presenting a narrative that clearly and accurately reflects your financial strength to underwriters.</p>
