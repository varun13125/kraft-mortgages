          q: "What is CMHC MLI Select?",
          a: "MLI Select is CMHC's premium multi-unit residential insurance program that provides enhanced terms and premium discounts for projects that achieve affordability, energy efficiency, and accessibility goals through a point-based scoring system."
        },
        {
          q: "Who is eligible for MLI Select?",
          a: "Developers and property owners building new multi-unit residential projects (5+ units) can apply. Projects must meet minimum scoring thresholds and commit to long-term affordability requirements."
        },
        {
          q: "What are the minimum requirements?",
          a: "Projects must achieve at least 50 points across the three categories (Affordability, Energy Efficiency, Accessibility) and maintain certain rent-to-income ratios for eligible tenants."

      icon: Building,
      questions: [
        {
          q: "How does the scoring system work?",
          a: "Projects earn points in three categories: Affordability (up to 50 points), Energy Efficiency (up to 30 points), and Accessibility (up to 20 points). Total points determine your tier level and benefits."
        },
        {
          q: "What are the tier thresholds?",
          a: "Tier 50: 50-69 points, Tier 70: 70-99 points, Tier 100: 100+ points. Higher tiers unlock greater premium discounts and enhanced lending terms."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I improve my tier after initial approval?",
          a: "Yes, you can enhance your project design to achieve a higher tier, but changes must be approved by CMHC before construction begins."
        }

      icon: DollarSign,
      questions: [
        {
          q: "How much can I save on insurance premiums?",
          a: "Premium discounts range from 5-10% for Tier 50, 15-20% for Tier 70, and up to 25% for Tier 100. On a $10M project, this could mean savings of $75K to $500K."
        },
        {
          q: "What loan-to-value ratios are available?",
          a: "MLI Select offers enhanced LTV ratios compared to standard CMHC programs. Higher tiers unlock progressively better leverage, reducing your equity requirements."
        },
        {
          q: "Are there extended amortization options?",
          a: "Yes, MLI Select projects can qualify for amortization periods up to 40 years, significantly improving cash flow compared to standard 25-year terms."

      questions: [
        {
          q: "How long does the approval process take?",
          a: "Initial review typically takes 4-6 weeks. Higher tier applications (Tier 70+) receive priority processing, with Tier 100 projects getting expedited approval."
        },
        {
          q: "What documentation is required?",
          a: "You'll need detailed architectural plans, energy efficiency reports, affordability commitments, accessibility specifications, and financial projections. Our team helps compile the complete package."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I apply before finalizing my design?",
          a: "We recommend preliminary consultation during design phase to optimize your point scoring. Formal application requires substantially complete plans and specifications."
